The link format should comply to one of the following formats:

#+begin_verse
Linking with a custom ID:
wiki:WIKIID:[subdir/]TITLE[::#customid]

Linking with a heading:
wiki:WIKIID:[subdir/]TITLE[::*heading]
#+end_verse

=TITLE= can be either the base name of an escaped file name (i.e. without =.org=) or its original top-level heading. File resolution can be done in the following process:

1. It tries to find a file with with the title
2. It escapes the title into a safe file name and tries to find a file with the base name.
3. It tries to find a file with a top-level heading matching the title in the directory.

=WIKIID= can be ~*~ which means the default wiki on the host.
