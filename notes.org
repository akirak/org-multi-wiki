When it inserts a link to an entry in the same wiki, it should omit the directory ID.

Perhaps it can be implemented by advising =org-link-make-string= to modify the link.
This is a hack, but this seems to be the only way according to the current implementation of =org-insert-link=.
I will a custom variable to enable this feature.

It should be able to store a link to a non-org file in a wiki directory.
Inline images inserted via the link scheme should be displayed properly.
